# PyTorch for Deep Learning

This repository's purpose to host practice code for the Learn `PyTorch for Deep Learning` course by Daniel Bourke. The course is said to teach the foundations of machine learning and deep learning with PyTorch (a machine learning framework written in Python).

## What will I build in the course?

We start with the barebone fundamentals of PyTorch and machine learning, so even if you're new to machine learning you'll be caught up to speed.

Then we’ll explore more advanced areas including PyTorch neural network classification, PyTorch workflows, computer vision, custom datasets, experiment tracking, model deployment, and my personal favourite: transfer learning, a powerful technique for taking what one machine learning model has learned on another problem and applying it to your own!

Along the way, you’ll build three milestone projects surrounding an overarching project called FoodVision, a neural network computer vision model to classify images of food.

These milestone projects will help you practice using PyTorch to cover important machine learning concepts and create a portfolio you can show employers and say "here's what I've done".
